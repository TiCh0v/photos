    "description": "1966 Chevrolet Chevelle SS – STK 2801. The 1966 Chevelle SS396 captivated onlookers with its striking appearance. The revamped Fisher body ushered in a new era for the mid-size Chevy, establishing it as a performance icon. In this iteration, the SS396 evolved into a distinct model within the Chevelle lineup, showcasing numerous styling upgrades and an unwavering focus on performance. This ‘138’ code Chevelle SS396 underwent an impressive frame-off restoration in 2013, emerging as a visual masterpiece. A professional application of Bolero Red paint revitalized the exterior, complemented by a meticulous restoration of the interior in original red vinyl. Every authentic detail, including the Muncie ‘hypodermic’ shifter, was thoughtfully recreated. The cabin features a complete set of SunPro gauges alongside a column-mounted tachometer, tinted windows, and an aftermarket AM/FM/cassette stereo system. Under the hood, the original 396ci ‘Rat’ powerplant gave way to a robust 427ci big-block. This powerhouse, meticulously rebuilt, boasts an aluminum intake, dual-line Holley carburetor, and a street-savvy cam. Paired with a 4-speed manual transmission, the throaty exhaust note resonates with power. (Trivia: A few years later, Don Yenko Chevrolet in Pittsburgh adopted a similar drivetrain package for their COPO Chevelles.) GM Rally wheels with trim rings and centers embrace sturdy 15” BFG Radial T/A tires. Steering is managed manually, while power disc/drum brakes, a front sway bar, and HD shocks contribute to a balanced driving experience.",
